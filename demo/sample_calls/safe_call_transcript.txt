Hey Sarah! It's been way too long. I was just thinking about you the other day when I drove past that little coffee shop we used to go to after class. Remember the one on Oak Street?

Anyway, I'm calling because Mike and I are throwing a barbecue next Saturday, the 15th, around 4 PM. Nothing fancy — just burgers, some corn on the grill, and probably too many desserts because you know how Mike gets.

We'd love it if you and Tom could make it. Jake and Emma are coming too, and I think Chris might drive down from Portland. It would be so great to have the whole group together again.

Oh, and don't worry about bringing anything. Well, maybe that amazing potato salad you made last summer if you're feeling generous? No pressure though, ha!

Just text me and let me know. Hope you guys are doing well. Talk soon!
