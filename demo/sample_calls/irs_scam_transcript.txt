This is Officer Johnson from the Internal Revenue Service enforcement division. We have been trying to reach you regarding a serious matter. Our records indicate that you owe $4,782 in back taxes from the years 2022 and 2023. A federal arrest warrant has been issued in your name and local law enforcement has been notified.

If you do not resolve this immediately, officers will be dispatched to your home or workplace within the next 45 minutes. You could face up to 5 years in federal prison and have your assets seized.

However, you can settle this right now and avoid arrest. You need to purchase Google Play gift cards totaling $4,782 and provide me with the redemption codes. This is a special government payment program. Do not hang up or speak to anyone else about this call — doing so will be considered obstruction of a federal investigation.

I need you to go to your nearest Walgreens or CVS right now. Stay on the line with me. What store are you heading to? Time is running out. Once you provide the gift card codes, your case will be closed and the warrant will be canceled immediately.

Do you understand the severity of this situation? This is your final warning before we proceed with the arrest.
